### (R.I.S.E.) — Rust for Industry, Stability, and Longevity

> **Rewrite the base. Build compilers that sustain themselves.**  
> LLVM-Free · Industrial LTS · Embedded Rust for the Next Decade.

## 🧭 Overview

**Rust-Industrial-Stable-Edition-With-No-LLVM (R.I.S.E.)**  
is an experimental long-term, LLVM-free Rust edition designed  
for **embedded, industrial, and long-lived systems**.

It extends the Rust-LTSS vision under the R3C ecosystem,  
offering a **compiler pipeline fully independent of LLVM**.

## 🧩 Philosophy

> “Rust for factories, satellites, and systems that must live decades —  
> not for nightly builds, but for human time.”

Modern Rust is fast-moving, but industries demand *stability over novelty.*  
R.I.S.E. is a **Rust LTS** variant focusing on:

- 🧱 Predictable builds  
- ⚙️ Minimal dependencies  
- 🧩 LLVM-free backend  
- 🏗 Long-term maintainability  
- 🔒 Safety, determinism, and transparency

## 🧠 Architecture

```text
[C++ Source]

[R3C Compiler Core]  ←  (LLVM-Free)
   ↓
[Rust-LTSS Runtime Layer]
   ↓
[ASM Output]  →  Industrial Targets (ARM, RISC-V, x86)
````

* **R3C** — C++ → Rust → ASM compiler
* **Rust-LTSS** — Long-Term Sustain System
* **CPP.PM** — Package & Manifest manager for deterministic builds
* **LLVM-Zero** — Optional backend research layer

All components are integrated through the
[R3C Foundation](https://github.com/r3c-foundation/r3c-ecosystem).

## 🧱 Example Workflow

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/r3c-foundation/rust-industrial-stable-edition-with-no-llvm.git
cd rust-industrial-stable-edition-with-no-llvm

# Configure & build
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel 4

# Run self-healing tests
python3 scripts/self_heal_tests.py
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

1. **Autonomy over dependency**
   → Rust must live without LLVM.
2. **Stability over speed**
   → Predictable releases > nightly churn.
3. **Transparency over abstraction**
   → Every compiler stage must be visible.
4. **Longevity over novelty**
   → Software that outlives its authors.
